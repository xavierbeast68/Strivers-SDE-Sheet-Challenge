<!-- Problem Statement -->
You are given an array of size ‘N’. The elements of the array are in the range from 1 to ‘N’.

Ideally, the array should contain elements from 1 to ‘N’. But due to some miscalculations, there is a number R in the range [1, N] which appears in the array twice and another number M in the range [1, N] which is missing from the array.

Your task is to find the missing number (M) and the repeating number (R).



<strong>For Example:</strong>
<pre>Consider an array of size six. The elements of the array are { 6, 4, 3, 5, 5, 1 }. 
The array should contain elements from one to six. Here, 2 is not present and 5 is occurring twice. Thus, 2 is the missing number (M) and 5 is the repeating number (R).</pre>


<strong>Follow Up:</strong>
<pre>Can you do this in linear time and constant additional space? </pre>


<strong>Input Format:</strong>
<pre>The first line contains an integer ‘N’ denoting the size of the array.
The second line contains ‘N’ space-separated integers.</pre>


<strong>Output Format:</strong>
<pre>Print the missing number (M) and the repeating number (R) separated by a single space. </pre>


<strong>Note:</strong>
<pre>You don’t have to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the function. 
You have to return a pair whose first element is the missing number ‘M’ and the second element is the repeating number ‘R’. </pre>


<strong>Constraints:</strong>
<pre>
2 <= N <= 5 * 10^4
1 <= data <= N

Where ‘N’ is the size of the array and ‘data’ denotes the value of the elements of the array. </pre>
